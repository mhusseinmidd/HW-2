## Question 1:

Question 4 on page 76 from Chapter 4 of Data Analysis Using Regression and
Multilevel/Hierarchical Models.  The codebook can be found
[here](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/arm/examples/pollution/pollution.txt).
I've included R code blocks for each question, but use them only if you feel it
necessary.

```{r, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
# DO NOT EDIT THIS SECTION!
url <- "http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/arm/examples/pollution/pollution.dta"
pollution <- read.dta(url) %>% 
  tbl_df()
```

### a) 
It appears that a linear model does not adequetly describe the relationshion 
between Nitric Oxide pollution levels and  mortality rates. This is confirmed by
two pieces of evidence: First, This graph between the Nitric Oxide and mortality
rates indicates a poor representation of the relationship, since the majority of 
points are constrained below 100 and display a non-linear relationship. More to
the point, the residual graphs does show a pattern, implying a non-constant variance. 


```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
ggplot(data=pollution, aes(x = nox, y = mort))+
      geom_point() +
      ggtitle("Mortaility vs. Nitric Oxide Levels") +
      xlab("Relative Nitric Oxide Pollution Potential") +
      ylab("Total Age-adjusted Mortality Rate per 100,000") + 
      theme(plot.title = element_text(lineheight=.8, face="bold")) + 
      theme(axis.title.y=element_text(margin=margin(0,12,0,0))) + 
      geom_smooth(method="lm", fullrange=TRUE) 

model1a.1  <- lm(mort~nox, data=pollution)
residuals1a.1 <- resid(model1a.1)

ggplot(data=pollution, aes(x = nox, y = residuals1a.1))+
      geom_point()+
      ggtitle("Residuals vs. Nitric Oxide Levels") +
      xlab("Relative Nitric Oxide Pollution Potential") +
      ylab("Residuals")

```


### b)
The residual graph shows a random dispersion of residuals, suggesting a constant 
variance. Further, it appears as though the residuals are centered around zero. 
This implies that our second model fits the data well. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
pollution <- pollution %>% 
            mutate(log_nox=log(nox))

  ggplot(data=pollution, aes(x=log_nox, y=mort)) +
        geom_jitter() +
        ggtitle("Mortaility vs. Logged Nitric Oxide Levels") +
        xlab("Log of Relative Nitric Oxide Pollution Potential") +
        ylab("Total Age-adjusted Mortality Rate per 100,000") + 
        geom_smooth(method="lm", fullrange=TRUE) 

model1b.1  <- lm(mort~log_nox, data=pollution)
residuals1b.1 <- resid(model1b.1)

ggplot(data=pollution, aes(x = log_nox, y = residuals1b.1))+
      geom_point()+ 
      ggtitle("Residuals vs. Logged Nitric Oxide Levels") +
      xlab("Logged Relative Nitric Oxide Pollution Potential") +
      ylab("Residuals")

```


### c)
A one unit increase in the logged nitric oxide level would result in a 
15.335 increase in the age-adjusted total mortality rate per 100,000. We are 
95% confident that the effect lies between 2.13 and 28.5 increased mortailities 
per 100,000 adjusted for age. 


```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
log_model  <- lm(mort~log_nox, data=pollution)
summary(log_model)
confint(log_model)

```


### d)
First, we determin the relationship between the two additional covariates and
our outcome variable: 


```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
ggplot(data=pollution, aes(x=hc, y=mort)) + geom_jitter()
ggplot(data=pollution, aes(x=so2, y=mort)) + geom_jitter()

```
It appears that there exists a non-linear relationship between our two new 
dependent variables and our outcome variable that is best approximated 
by a log transformation: 

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
pollution <- pollution %>% 
             mutate(log_hc=log(hc)) %>% 
             mutate(log_so2=log(so2))

log_model2  <- lm(mort~log_nox + log_hc + log_so2, data=pollution)
summary(log_model2)
confint(log_model2)
```

From this new model we see that a one unit increase in the logged nitric oxide 
levels lead to a 58.336 increase in the total mortality rate per 100,000 people, 
controlling forlevels of sulphur dioxide and hydrocarbon. 

### e)

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}

```
No clue how to approach this ... 

### f) What do you think are the reasons for using cross-validation?
Cross-validation tests the efficacy of a model by using a subset of the
available dataset to fit the model, then testing its ability to predict using the
the remainder of the dataset. This technique is preferable to evaluating 
residuals as it demonstrates how well a model will do when facing 'new data.'


## Question 2:

Perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the OkCupid data, keeping in mind 
in HW-3, you will be fitting a logistic regression to predict gender. What do I mean by
EDA?

* Visualizations
* Tables
* Numerical summaries

For the R Markdown to work, you must first copy the file `profiles.csv` from
Lec09 to the project directory `HW-2`.

```{r, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
# DO NOT EDIT THIS SECTION!
profiles <- read.csv("profiles.csv", header=TRUE) %>% tbl_df()
```


```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
cont_var <- profiles %>%            
            filter (income>0) %>% 
            mutate (female=ifelse(sex=="f", 1, 0)) %>% 
            summarise (age_mean_total=mean(age), na.rm=TRUE) %>% 
            summarise (height_mean_total=mean(height), na.rm=TRUE) %>% 
            summarise (income_mean_total=mean(income), na.rm=TRUE) %>% 
#Broken down by sex: 
            group_by(female) %>% 
            summarise (age_mean=mean(age), na.rm=TRUE) %>% 
            summarise (height_mean=mean(height), na.rm=TRUE) %>% 
            summarise (income_mean=mean(income), na.rm=TRUE) %>% 
            select(23:29)

kable(cont_var, format="markdown")
# #I suspect income =-1 is code for missing, we have to filter that out, otherwise
# it skews the results. The challenge is could bias our results. We fix this by 
# noting our decision in by the table. 
```
